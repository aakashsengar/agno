AWS SES (Simple Email Service) Setup Instructions:

1. Create an AWS account if you don't have one
   - Go to https://aws.amazon.com and sign up
   - Add a payment method (required even for free tier)

2. Go to AWS SES Console and verify your domain or email address:
   - For production:
     a. Go to AWS SES Console > Verified Identities > Create Identity
     b. Choose "Domain" and follow DNS verification steps
     c. Add DKIM and SPF records to your domain's DNS
   - For testing:
     a. Choose "Email Address" verification
     b. Click verification link sent to your email

3. Check SES Sending Limits:
   - New accounts start in sandbox mode with limits:
     * 200 emails per 24-hour period
     * 1 email per second
   - To increase limits:
     a. Go to SES Console > Account Dashboard
     b. Click "Request Production Access"
     c. Fill out the form with your use case

4. Configure AWS Credentials:
   a. Create an IAM user:
      - Go to IAM Console > Users > Add User
      - Enable "Programmatic access"
      - Attach 'AmazonSESFullAccess' policy

   b. Set up credentials (choose one method):
      Method 1 - Using AWS CLI:
      ```
      aws configure
      # Enter your AWS Access Key ID
      # Enter your AWS Secret Access Key
      # Enter your default region
      ```

      Method 2 - Manual credentials file:
      Create ~/.aws/credentials with:
      ```
      [default]
      aws_access_key_id = YOUR_ACCESS_KEY
      aws_secret_access_key = YOUR_SECRET_KEY
      ```

      Method 3 - Environment variables:
      ```
      export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=YOUR_ACCESS_KEY
      export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=YOUR_SECRET_KEY
      ```

5. Configure OpenAI API:
   a. Get your API key from https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
   b. Set the environment variable:
      ```
      export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
      ```

6. Install required Python packages:
   ```
   pip install boto3 agno
   ```

7. Update the variables below with your configuration:
   - sender_email: Your verified sender email address
   - sender_name: Display name that appears in email clients
   - region_name: AWS region where SES is set up (e.g., 'us-east-1', 'ap-south-1')

Troubleshooting:
- If emails aren't sending, check:
  * Both sender and recipient are verified (in sandbox mode)
  * AWS credentials are correctly configured
  * You're within sending limits
  * Your IAM user has correct SES permissions
- Check CloudWatch for delivery metrics and errors
- Use SES Console's 'Send Test Email' feature to verify setup
